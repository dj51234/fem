## 🛠️ Monorepo Structure

The repository is organized to keep each application isolated while sharing a common deployment pipeline.

```text
fem/
├── index.html                    # Main Hub / Portfolio Gallery
├── qr-code-component-main/       # Pokémon Card Opener project
├── [future-app-folder]/          # Upcoming projects
└── README.md

```

## 🌐 Hosting & Deployment

This entire collection is hosted on **GitHub Pages**.

- The root `index.html` acts as a directory for all sub-apps.
- Each folder is accessible at `https://dj51234.github.io/fem/[folder-name]/`.

## 🛠️ Setup for New Projects

To add a new application to this repo:

1. Create a new directory at the root.
2. Ensure all asset paths (images, CSS, JS) are **relative** (e.g., `./style.css`) to ensure they resolve correctly on GitHub Pages.
3. Add a new project card to the main `index.html` hub.
